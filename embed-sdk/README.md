Embed SDK
=========

Data structures for the Embed system used within Lantern and the Embed microservice.

This crate re-exports parts of Lantern's Client SDK for use in the Embed microservice, and
relicenses them under MIT or Apache 2.0 for ease of use in other projects.

TypeScript definitions are provided in `index.d.ts`, generated from the Client SDK.
